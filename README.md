# Module 3: Working with Data in R

The tutorial file `Working-with-data-in-R` is available as two file types: `.html` and `.md`. Once you clone the repository to your computer, you can open the .html file using a web browser. The .md file can be viewed on GitHub. 

To get started with this module, go through the following steps (similar to those in Module 2, except you won't be submitting a pull request this time):

1. Fork this repository (`BAE-R-Coding/Module-3`) to your own. 
2. Create a project in RStudio using the ["Existing project, Github first"](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html#existing-github-first) workflow. 
3. Your RStudio project should now be open. Confirm that the GitHub repository was cloned to your computer. 
4. Create a branch: enter `git checkout -b my-branch master` in the shell. Note that you can change the branch name to whatever you'd like, it doesn't need to be "my-branch". 
5. Confirm that you are working from the new branch you just created by checking the `Git` tab on RStudio. 
6. Work on the tutorial!
7. Once you're done, you're welcome (and encouraged!) to commit and push any changes you made to your project directory **but exclude** the R script with your exercise responses. Remember that you can commit and push your changes from the `Git` tab in RStudio.
